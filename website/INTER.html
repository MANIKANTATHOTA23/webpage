		<i><b> I studied in FIITJEE JUNIOR COLLEGE in VIJAYAWADA .</b></i>
		<p> FIITJEE was created in 1992 by the vision and toil of Mr. D. K. Goel, a Mechanical Engineering Graduate from IIT Delhi. </p>
		<p>We had a very humble beginning as a forum for IIT-JEE, with a vision to provide an ideal launch pad for serious JEE aspirants.</p>
		<p>Along the way to realization of this vision, we went beyond merely coaching for IIT-JEE. </p>
		<p>They actually started to make a difference in the way Students think and approach problems. </p>
		<p>They started to develop ways to enhance Studentsâ€™ IQ. </p>
		<p>They started to leave an indelible mark on the Students who have undergone FIITJEE training.</p>
		<p>They started changing lives. And all this was not a sheer coincidence.</p>
		<p>It was the urge, the compelling desire, to always aspire for perfection and in the process,continuously keep on setting newer benchmarks of excellence, which enabled us and our Students to achieve what we have achieved.</p>
